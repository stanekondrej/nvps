# nvps - a script to search for nvim plugins  
**NeoVim Plugin Search** - nothing but a thin wrapper around the amazing [nvim.sh](https://nvim.sh)  

## usage  
quite simple: build it, and write any plugins you want to search for as cmdline arguments  

## installation  
- install the rust toolchain through [rustup](https://rustup.sh)
- `cargo install nvps`

## credit  
thank you, creator of nvim.sh
